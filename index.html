        <h1> What is IIRF? </h1>
        <p>
            One form that is frequently used is the Individual Inventory Record Form (IIRF). 
            It is utilized at a number of educational establishments, including the Polytechnic
            University of the Philippines' guidance, counseling,
            and testing services department. Its main objective is to compile thorough 
            details on a specific student for a range of uses, including academic counseling, 
            academic tracking, career planning, and counseling. The following data will be gathered from the student via the form:
            <br> <br>
            1. Personal Information: Name, address, phone number, and other basic personal information about the student are gathered in this part such as 
            height, weight, complexion, religion, and contact details in case of emergency. This aids in creating a fundamental profile of the learner.
            This guarantees that in the event of an emergency, the institution may get in touch with them or their assigned contact.
            <br> <br>
            2. Home and Family Background: In-depth information on the student's parents, guardians, siblings, marital status, level of education, and line of work are all included in this part that explores family dynamics. It also evaluates the family's financial situation and establishes the potential amount of educational help that the student will require.
            <br> <br>
            3. Interests & Hobbies: The student's favorite topics, extracurricular activities, and hobbies are all included in this section. It offers perceptions into the skills, interests, and extracurricular activities of the student, which can be helpful for their personal growth and involvement in extracurricular activities.
